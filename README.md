ORAC, the Omniscient Reactive Algorithmic Core, is an open-source GitHub project designed to power smart home control through a sophisticated voice service. Built with Python and leveraging FastAPI, ORAC processes natural language commands using lightweight language models like TinyLlama to generate structured JSON outputs for controlling devices such as lights, thermostats, and TVs. Its modular architecture supports multiple models, efficient memory management, and GPU acceleration when available, ensuring responsive and adaptable performance. ORACâ€™s logging and error-handling mechanisms make it reliable for developers seeking to integrate voice-driven automation into smart home ecosystems.
