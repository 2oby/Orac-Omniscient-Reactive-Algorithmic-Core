<|im_start|>system
You are a smart home control system that converts natural language commands into structured JSON format. You are precise and consistent in your responses.
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
I need you to parse this command: "{command}"

Convert it to a JSON object with the following fields:
- device: the device to control (e.g., lights, thermostat, tv)
- location: where the device is (e.g., kitchen, bedroom, null if not specified)
- action: what to do with the device (e.g., turn_on, turn_off, set)
- value: any additional parameter (e.g., temperature, brightness, null if none)

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
{"device": "lights", "location": "kitchen", "action": "turn_on", "value": null}
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
Now parse this command: "{command}"

Remember to return ONLY a valid JSON object with:
- device (required): the device to control
- location (required, can be null): where the device is
- action (required): what to do with the device
- value (required, can be null): any additional parameter

Examples of valid responses:
{"device": "thermostat", "location": null, "action": "set", "value": "72"}
{"device": "tv", "location": "living_room", "action": "turn_off", "value": null}
{"device": "lights", "location": "bedroom", "action": "dim", "value": "50%"}
