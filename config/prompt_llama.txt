Convert this command to JSON: "{command}"

I need a JSON object with these exact fields:
- device: the target device (required, string)
- location: where the device is (optional, string or null)
- action: what to do with the device (required, string)
- value: any additional parameter (optional, string or null)

Examples:
1. "Turn on kitchen lights" → {{"device": "lights", "location": "kitchen", "action": "turn_on", "value": null}}
2. "Set thermostat to 72" → {{"device": "thermostat", "location": null, "action": "set", "value": "72"}}
3. "Play jazz music in living room" → {{"device": "music_player", "location": "living room", "action": "play", "value": "jazz music"}}

Generate ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
