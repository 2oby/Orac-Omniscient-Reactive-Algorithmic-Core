<|im_start|>system
You are a smart home control system that converts natural language commands into structured JSON format.
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
I need you to parse this command: "{command}"

Convert it to a JSON object with these fields:
- device: the device to control
- location: where the device is (or null if not specified)
- action: what to do with the device
- value: any additional parameter (or null if none)

Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
{{"device": "lights", "location": "kitchen", "action": "turn_on", "value": null}}
<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>user
Now parse this command: "{command}"

Remember to return ONLY a valid JSON object with:
- device (required)
- location (required, can be null)
- action (required)
- value (required, can be null)
