# CURRENT FOCUS - ORAC Core Configuration & Home Assistant Integration

## Environment Overview

### Infrastructure
- **Jetson Orin (orin4)**: Main deployment target running ORAC Core in Docker
  - Access: `ssh orin4` (configured in local SSH config)
  - Docker deployment with persistent volumes for data/configs
  - Running at http://192.168.8.191:8000

- **Raspberry Pi**: Running ORAC STT (Speech-to-Text) service
  - Sends heartbeat updates to ORAC Core every 20 seconds
  - Updates topic status and wake word triggers

- **Deployment**: `./scripts/deploy_and_test.sh` script handles:
  - Git push to GitHub
  - Remote deployment on orin4
  - Docker container rebuild and restart
  - Automated testing

## Problem Statement
Topic configurations (especially Home Assistant dispatcher settings) were being lost:
1. After Docker container restarts
2. When heartbeat updates from ORAC STT overwrote saved configurations

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed API Models (âœ… WORKING)
- Added `dispatcher` field to API request/response models in `/orac/api_topics.py`:
  - `TopicUpdateRequest`
  - `TopicResponse` 
  - `TopicCreateRequest`
- This allows the dispatcher field to be properly serialized/deserialized

### 2. Fixed JavaScript Frontend (âœ… WORKING)
- Updated `/orac/static/js/topic_config.js` to properly capture dispatcher dropdown value
- Fixed empty string vs null handling for dispatcher field
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track save operations

### 3. Fixed Heartbeat Overwriting (âœ… DEPLOYED)
- Modified `/orac/api_heartbeat.py` to reload topics from disk before updating
- Prevents heartbeat from overwriting user-configured settings like dispatcher
- Code change:
```python
else:
    # Reload topics to get latest saved state (including dispatcher)
    topic_manager.load_topics()
    topic = topic_manager.get_topic(topic_id)
```

### 4. Fixed Configuration Persistence - Singleton Pattern (âœ… FIXED 2025-09-06)
- **Root Cause**: Multiple TopicManager instances across modules causing state inconsistency
  - `api.py`, `api_topics.py`, and `api_heartbeat.py` each created their own TopicManager instance
  - Updates via API only affected one instance while heartbeat saved from another
- **Solution**: Implemented singleton pattern for TopicManager
  - Created `/orac/topic_manager_singleton.py` to ensure single shared instance
  - Updated all modules to use the singleton: `from orac.topic_manager_singleton import topic_manager`
- **Result**: Configuration changes now persist correctly through:
  - Heartbeat updates (every 30 seconds)
  - Container restarts
  - Both `general` and `computa` topics retain their dispatcher settings

### 5. System Prompt Configuration (âœ… WORKING)
- Configured Home Assistant control prompt:
```
You are a smart home assistant. Convert natural language commands into JSON format for controlling smart home devices. Focus on device control actions like turning lights on/off, adjusting brightness, etc. Output only valid JSON with keys: device, action, location.
```

### 6. Natural Language Parsing (âœ… WORKING)
- System correctly parses commands like "turn off the lounge lamp"
- Generates proper JSON: `{"device":"lights","action":"off","location":"living room"}`

## Current Issues

### 1. ~~Configuration Loss on Container Restart~~ (âœ… FIXED)
~~Despite volume mounting (`./data:/app/data`), configurations may still be lost on container restart.~~
- **FIXED**: Implemented singleton pattern for TopicManager to ensure consistent state across all modules
- Configuration now persists correctly through restarts and heartbeats

### 2. Home Assistant Command Execution (ðŸ”´ NOT WORKING)
- Commands are parsed correctly but lights don't actually turn off
- The dispatcher is set to "homeassistant" but the command isn't reaching Home Assistant
- Need to verify:
  - Home Assistant connection (HA_URL, HA_TOKEN environment variables)
  - Entity ID mapping (switch.tretakt_smart_plug for Lounge Lamp Plug)
  - Dispatcher execution pipeline

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Fix Configuration Persistence**
   - Check `/orac/topic_manager.py:119` - `_ensure_default_topic()` method
   - Verify it's not overwriting existing topics.yaml on container restart
   - Add logging to track when/why topics.yaml is being overwritten

2. **Debug Home Assistant Integration**
   - Add logging to track dispatcher execution in `/orac/dispatchers/homeassistant.py`
   - Verify Home Assistant connection is established
   - Check if commands are being sent to Home Assistant
   - Verify entity mappings are correct

3. **Test Command Flow End-to-End**
   ```bash
   # Test via API directly
   curl -X POST http://192.168.8.191:8000/v1/generate/general \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "turn off the lounge lamp"}'
   ```

### Code Locations for Investigation

1. **Topic Persistence**: 
   - `/orac/topic_manager.py` - Check `_ensure_default_topic()` and `load_topics()`
   - `/data/topics.yaml` - Verify file persistence on host

2. **Dispatcher Execution**:
   - `/orac/api_generation.py` - Where dispatcher is invoked after LLM generation
   - `/orac/dispatchers/homeassistant.py` - Home Assistant command execution
   - `/orac/homeassistant/client.py` - HA API client

3. **Entity Mapping**:
   - `/orac/homeassistant/entity_mappings.yaml` - Check if Lounge Lamp Plug is mapped
   - Entity ID should be: `switch.tretakt_smart_plug`

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check if topics.yaml persists on host
cat ./data/topics.yaml | grep dispatcher

# Monitor logs during save
docker logs -f orac

# Test heartbeat doesn't overwrite
# 1. Save configuration with dispatcher
# 2. Wait 30 seconds for heartbeat
# 3. Check if dispatcher still set

# Direct Home Assistant test
curl -X POST http://192.168.8.191:8000/v1/homeassistant/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"entity_id": "switch.tretakt_smart_plug", "action": "turn_off"}'
```

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… Topic configurations persist through Docker container restarts
2. âœ… Heartbeat updates don't overwrite user configurations
3. âœ… Natural language commands control Home Assistant devices
4. âœ… "Turn off the lounge lamp" actually turns off the lamp

## Related Files Modified
- `/orac/api_heartbeat.py` - Fixed heartbeat overwriting, updated to use singleton
- `/orac/api_topics.py` - Added dispatcher field to models, updated to use singleton
- `/orac/api.py` - Updated to use singleton TopicManager
- `/orac/static/js/topic_config.js` - Fixed dropdown value capture
- `/orac/topic_manager.py` - Added debug logging
- `/orac/topic_manager_singleton.py` - **NEW** - Singleton wrapper for TopicManager

## Environment Variables Required
```yaml
HA_URL: http://192.168.8.100:8123
HA_TOKEN: [Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token]
```

## Current Command Output
- Input: "turn off the lounge lamp"
- LLM Output: `{"device":"lights","action":"off","location":"living room"}`
- Expected: Lounge Lamp Plug (switch.tretakt_smart_plug) turns off
- Actual: Command parsed correctly but device doesn't respond
