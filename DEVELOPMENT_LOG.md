**Implementation**:
- Modal popup triggered when NULL mappings detected
- Progressive disclosure (one entity at a time)
- Smart suggestions based on entity_id parsing
- Skip option for unwanted entities
- Integration with mapping API endpoints

**Benefits**:
- Better user experience
- No manual YAML editing required
- Automatic grammar updates

#### **Option 3: Grammar Persistence** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**What**: Save generated grammar to file for persistence across restarts
**Why**: Avoid regenerating grammar on every startup
**Implementation**:
- Save grammar to `data/grammar.json`
- Load grammar on application startup
- Update grammar when mappings change
- Version control for grammar changes

**Benefits**:
- Faster startup times
- Grammar versioning
- Offline capability

#### **Option 4: CLI Commands** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**What**: Add command-line tools for discovery and mapping management
**Why**: Provides administrative access and automation
**Implementation**:
- `orac discover` - Run auto-discovery
- `orac mapping list` - List current mappings
- `orac mapping add <entity_id> <friendly_name>` - Add mapping
- `orac grammar generate` - Generate grammar constraints

**Benefits**:
- Administrative control
- Automation capabilities
- Debugging and maintenance

#### **Option 5: Enhanced Testing** ‚≠ê **LOWER PRIORITY**
**What**: Expand test coverage and add integration tests
**Why**: Ensure reliability and catch regressions

- Confidence in changes

### **üéØ Recommended Next Action**

**I recommend starting with Option 1: Add API Endpoints for Mapping** because:

1. **Foundation First**: API endpoints are required for the UI popup system
2. **Self-Contained**: Can be implemented and tested independently
3. **Immediate Value**: Provides programmatic access to mappings
4. **Low Risk**: Simple REST endpoints with clear requirements

**Implementation Plan for API Endpoints**:
1. Add endpoints to `orac/api.py`
2. Integrate with existing `EntityMappingConfig`
3. Add proper error handling and validation
4. Test endpoints with curl or Postman
5. Update documentation

**After API endpoints are complete**, we can move to Option 2 (UI Popup System) which will use these endpoints to provide the user-friendly interface for handling NULL values.

### **üìä Success Metrics**

**Current Achievements**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-discovery working with 7 entities
- ‚úÖ Grammar generation with 5 devices, 84 actions
- ‚úÖ NULL fallback system operational
- ‚úÖ Permission issues resolved
- ‚úÖ Container deployment working

**Next Milestone Targets**:
- üîÑ API endpoints for mapping operations
- üîÑ UI popup system for NULL value handling
- üîÑ Grammar persistence across restarts
- üîÑ CLI commands for administrative access

### 5.3 Testing and Validation

**Goal**: Add comprehensive test suite for discovery process.
