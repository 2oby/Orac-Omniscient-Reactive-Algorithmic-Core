# ORAC Development Log

## Overview

This document tracks the development progress of ORAC's Home Assistant auto-discovery system. It documents what has been implemented, what worked, what didn't, and lessons learned during development.

## Phase 1: Core Discovery Infrastructure

### 1.1 Enhanced API Client (`orac/homeassistant/client.py`)

**Goal**: Add new API endpoints for entity registry and device registry to enable area assignment discovery.

**What Was Implemented**:
- Added `API_ENTITY_REGISTRY = "/api/config/entity_registry/list"` to constants
- Added `API_DEVICE_REGISTRY = "/api/config/device_registry/list"` to constants
- Implemented `get_entity_registry()` method with caching and error handling
- Implemented `get_device_registry()` method with caching and error handling
- Added proper error handling for 404 responses (endpoints not available)

**What Worked**:
- ‚úÖ Constants properly defined in `orac/homeassistant/constants.py`
- ‚úÖ Client methods successfully implemented with async/await pattern
- ‚úÖ Error handling gracefully catches 404 errors and returns empty lists

**Test Results** (2025-06-20):
```
‚úÖ Entity Registry: Returns 0 entries (404 handled gracefully)
‚úÖ Device Registry: Returns 0 entries (404 handled gracefully)
