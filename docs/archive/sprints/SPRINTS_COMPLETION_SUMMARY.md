## Deployment Status

### Successfully Deployed to Jetson Orin
- **Date**: September 21, 2025
- **URL**: http://192.168.8.192:8000/backends
- **Commit**: "Sprint 2: Backend configuration and entity management"
- **Tests**: All passing ✅

### Current Capabilities:
1. Create and manage Home Assistant backends
2. Test backend connections in real-time
3. Fetch all entities from Home Assistant
4. Configure entities with friendly names and aliases
5. Enable/disable entities for voice control
6. Persistent storage of all configurations

---

## Next Sprint (Sprint 3) - Not Started

### Planned Features:
- Grammar generation from enabled entities
- Dispatcher configuration
- Topic-backend association
- Voice command testing
- Entity grouping/categorization
- Support for multiple backend types

### Files to Reference:
- Grammar generation patterns
- Dispatcher integration points
- Topic-backend mapping requirements

---

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made:
1. **File-based Storage**: Following TopicManager pattern
2. **Async Operations**: All HA operations are async
3. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately, saves in background
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery

### Known Limitations:
1. **Pagination**: Not implemented (may be needed for 500+ entities)
2. **WebSocket**: No real-time push updates from HA
3. **Backend Types**: Only Home Assistant supported currently

### Testing Coverage:
- ✅ Unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ✅ Home Assistant connection tests passing
- ✅ UI functionality verified on deployment

## Usage Instructions

### To Create a Backend:
1. Navigate to http://192.168.8.192:8000/backends
2. Click "Add New Backend"
3. Enter connection details:
   - Name: Friendly name for the backend
   - URL: http://[your-ha-ip]
   - Port: 8123 (default)
   - Token: Long-lived access token from HA
4. Click "Test Connection"
5. Click "Save & Next" when successful

### To Configure Entities:
1. From backends page, click "Entities" on a backend card
2. Click "Fetch Entities" to load from HA
3. Click entity cards to enable/disable
4. Click gear icon to configure:
   - Friendly name

## Summary

Both Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 are **FULLY COMPLETE** and **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**. The backend management system is fully functional and ready for use. Users can now create Home Assistant backends, manage entities, and configure them for future voice control integration.

The foundation is set for Sprint 3, which will focus on grammar generation and dispatcher configuration to enable actual voice command processing based on the configured entities.
