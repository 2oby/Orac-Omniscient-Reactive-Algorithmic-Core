# ORAC Integration - Current Focus

## 🔄 CURRENT STATUS: All Components Connected - Need Home Assistant Topic Configuration

**Last Updated**: September 4, 2025 - 15:15

### ⚠️ IP Address Change: Orin is now on WiFi at 192.168.8.192 (was 191)

### ✅ Completed Components:

#### **Hey ORAC (Raspberry Pi - 192.168.8.99)**
- Wake word detection fully operational
- Audio streaming with topic propagation implemented
- Heartbeat system active
- Per-model webhook URLs configured
- Topic selection per wake word model
- Web dashboard with monitoring
- **Branch**: master (topic system merged)
- **Status**: ✅ Production Ready

#### **ORAC STT (NVIDIA Orin - 192.168.8.192:7272)**  
- Speech-to-text transcription working
- Topic propagation to ORAC Core implemented
- Heartbeat monitoring active
- Web admin interface functional
- Forwards transcriptions with topic context
- **Branch**: master (topic system merged)
- **Status**: ✅ Production Ready

#### **ORAC Core (NVIDIA Orin - 192.168.8.192:8000)**
- Topic system fully implemented
- Grammar-based generation ready
- Home Assistant integration with HAExecutor class
- Entity mappings configured (including lounge lamp)
- HA Token configured and working
- **Branch**: master
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed and Running

### 🚧 Current Issue: Missing home_assistant Topic

The infrastructure is ready but the `home_assistant` topic doesn't exist. This topic is needed to:
- Route commands to grammar-constrained generation
- Use deterministic temperature (0.1)
- Execute commands via HAExecutor
- Map to Home Assistant entities

**Current topics in system:**
- `general` - General AI conversation
- `computa` - Computer-related commands (currently active from Hey ORAC)

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Configure home_assistant Topic Pipeline**
   - Create topic in ORAC Core
   - Configure grammar file (default.gbnf)
   - Set up API mappers
   - Configure Hey ORAC to use this topic

2. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Voice: "Computer, turn on the lounge lamp"
   - Verify: Wake → STT → Core → HA → Device

### 📊 System Connectivity Status:
- ✅ Hey ORAC (192.168.8.99:7171) - Connected
- ✅ ORAC STT (192.168.8.192:7272) - Connected  
- ✅ ORAC Core (192.168.8.192:8000) - Connected
- ✅ Home Assistant (192.168.8.99:8123) - Connected
- ✅ HA Token configured in ORAC Core

### 📋 Recent Changes (Sept 4, 2025):

- **Entity Mappings Updated**: Added `switch.lounge_lamp_plug` mapping as "lounge lamp"
- **HAExecutor Enhanced**: Added support for switch entities (smart plugs)
- **Environment Configuration**: Created .env file with HA_URL=http://192.168.8.99:8123
- **Integration Ready**: ORAC Core configured to execute HA commands after generation

  +Topic        +Topic            +Grammar       +Actions
```

### Communication Flow:
1. Hey ORAC detects wake word with associated topic
2. Audio streamed to ORAC STT with topic in URL path
3. ORAC STT transcribes and forwards to Core with topic
4. Core uses topic-specific grammar for generation
5. Generated commands sent to Home Assistant

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Check Hey ORAC status and topics
curl -s http://192.168.8.99:7171/api/v1/settings | jq '.models'

# Check ORAC STT health
curl -s http://192.168.8.192:7272/stt/v1/health

# Test ORAC Core (when deployed)
curl -X POST http://192.168.8.192:8000/v1/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "turn on bedroom lights", "topic": "home_assistant"}'
```

## 📝 Configuration Requirements

### Hey ORAC Model Configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "computer_v2",
  "webhook_url": "http://192.168.8.192:7272/stt/v1/stream",
  "topic": "home_assistant",
  "stt_enabled": true
}
```

### ORAC Core Topic Configuration:
- Topic: `home_assistant`
- Grammar: `default.gbnf` or topic-specific
- Temperature: 0.1 (deterministic output)
- Model: Configured LLM (e.g., Qwen3)
